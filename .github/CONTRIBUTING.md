## Bug reports

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported — [Issues]

2. Check if the issue has been fixed — Try to reproduce it using the latest `main` or `dev` branch

3. Isolate the problem

4. Submit using the `Bug report` template — [Submit a Bug report]

A good bug report shouldn't leave other needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.

Guidlines for feature requests:

1. Check if the feature has already been requested — [Issues]

2. Submit using the `Feature request` template — [Submit a feature request]

Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Guidlines for pull requests:

1. Fork the project and clone your fork

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream

3. Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks

5. Locally rebase the upstream `dev` branch into your topic branch

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork

7. Open a Pull request against the `dev` branch — [Open a Pull Request]

See [About pull requests] for more information.
