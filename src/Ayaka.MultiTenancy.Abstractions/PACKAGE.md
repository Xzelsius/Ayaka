## About

Provides abstractions for multi-tenanted applications. Interfaces defined in this package are implemented
by classes in [`Ayaka.MultiTenancy`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ayaka.MultiTenancy) and other multi-tenancy packages.

## Key Features

Defines abstractions for multi-tenancy functionality like `TenantContext`, `ITenantContextAccessor`, etc.

## How to Use

`Ayaka.MultiTenancy.Abstractions` does not provide any functionality on its own. The functionality comes
from classes in other packages.

But it allows you to create your own implementation in case the implementation provided by other packages
does not suit your needs.

## Additional Documentation

See [the documentation](https://xzelsius.github.io/Ayaka/guide/packages/multi-tenancy) for more details.
