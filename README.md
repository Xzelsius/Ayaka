Ayaka is a collection of packages, aiming to help developing applications using .NET.

## Compatibility

We aim to support the latest non-preview version of .NET.
See [.NET and .NET Core Support Policy] for more information.

There are no plans for any multi-target builds, as we don't want the additional complexity of such.

## Getting started

Soon... :)
