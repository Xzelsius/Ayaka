# Ayaka

Ayaka is a collection of packages, aiming to help developing applications using .NET.

## Compatibility

Ayaka aims to support the latest non-preview version of .NET.
Check the [Compatibility Documentation] for more information.

There are no plans for any multi-target builds, as I don't want the additional complexity of such.

## Documentation

I hope my [documentation] should help you get started with Ayaka.
If you still have any questions, feel free to ask in the [Discussions].
