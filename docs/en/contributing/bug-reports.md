# Bug Reports

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

## Guidelines

When creating a bug report, please follow these guidelines:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported — [Issues]
2. Check if the issue has been fixed — Try to reproduce it using the latest `main` branch
3. Isolate the problem
4. Submit using the `Bug report` template — [Submit a Bug report]

A good bug report shouldn't leave other needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
