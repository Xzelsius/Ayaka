# Pull Requests

Good pull requests are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

## Guidelines

When creating a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the project and clone your fork
2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream
3. Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix
4. Commit your changes in logical chunks
5. Locally rebase the upstream `main` branch into your topic branch
6. Push your topic branch up to your fork
7. Open a Pull request against the `main` branch â€” [Open a Pull Request]

See [About pull requests] for more information.

## Dependency Updates

Ayaka uses [renovate] to keep dependencies up-to-date. If you are submitting a pull request to update dependencies, the pull request will most likely be closed without further notice.
