# Ayaka.MultiTenancy

Provides functionality for creating multi-tenanted applications.

## What is Multi-Tenancy?

Multi-tenancy in a software application refers to an architecture where a single instance of the software
serves multiple tenants. Each tenant is a group of users who share common access with specific privileges
to the software instance.

Key points include:

* __Data Isolation__: Each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants
* __Resource Sharing__: The application instance and its resources (e.g., CPU, memory) are shared among all tenants.
* __Customization__: Tenants can have custom configurations, themes, or even functionality
* __Scalability__: Allows efficient scaling by serving multiple tenants from a single application instance
* __Cost Efficiency__: Reduces infrastructure and maintenance costs by consolidating resources

But these benefits come with challenges like:

* __Complexity__: Implementing multi-tenancy can add significant complexity to the application architecture, including
  data isolation, security, and tenant-specific customizations
* __Performance Overhead__: Sharing resources among multiple tenants can lead to performance bottlenecks,
  especially if one tenant's usage spikes
* __Security Risks__: Ensuring data isolation and preventing data leaks between tenants can be challenging
  and requires robust security measures
* __Customization Limitations__: While multi-tenancy allows for some level of customization, it may not be as
  flexible as having separate instances for each tenant
* __Maintenance Challenges__: Upgrading and maintaining a multi-tenant application can be more complex,
  as changes need to be compatible with all tenants
* __Testing Difficulties__: Testing a multi-tenant application can be more challenging due to the need to simulate
  multiple tenant environments and scenarios

## How does `Ayaka` help?

The `Ayaka.MultiTenancy` packages try to tackle the pros and cons by providing you the right tools for many
scenarios:

* [Tenant Context](./tenant-context.md) which is the heart of the multi-tenancy functionality
