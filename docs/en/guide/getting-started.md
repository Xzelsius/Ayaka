# Getting started

Ayaka is a collection of packages, aiming to help developing applications using .NET.

Don't hesitate and check out the [packages](./packages) to see what's available and if there is something
for you.

## Introduction

Over time, I found myself writing and reusing the same pieces of code across various personal projects,
which led to the idea of organizing and packaging these utilities into reusable libraries.

The main goal behind this project is to provide a set of tools that I find useful in my own work,
while also sharing them with the community. Although this is a hobby project maintained in my free time,
my hope is that these packages might help others save time or solve similar problems in their own
development process.

These packages are by no means intended to be exhaustive or one-size-fits-all solutions, but rather
a simple collection of utilities that Iâ€™ve found useful and that can hopefully provide value to others
working in .NET.
